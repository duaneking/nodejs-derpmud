A very simple MUD written in NodeJS as a personal test to see how fast I could learn NodeJS.

Supported commands:
	say - Say sormhting to other people.
	quit / exit - Quit
	go - go to antoher room (Exaple: go outside)
	look - look around you in the room you are in.

I forgot to set my name and email on the raspberry-pi Bv2+ I used to dev this,
so it says root@rasberrypi in the git history.

Not bad considering I had never really used nodejs before this project.
