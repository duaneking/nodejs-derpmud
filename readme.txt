A very simple MUD written in NodeJS as a personal test to see how fast I could learn NodeJS.

Supported commands:
	say - Say something to other people. (Example: 'say Hello!')
	quit / exit - Quit and close your connection.
	go - go to another room (Example: 'go outside')
	look - look around you in the room you are in. (Example: 'look')

Caveat:
I forgot to set my name and email on the raspberry-pi Bv2+ I used to dev this,
so it says root@rasberrypi in the git history.

Overall Results:
Not bad considering I had never really used nodejs before this project.
